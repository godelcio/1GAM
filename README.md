# One Game a Month

## Introduction
Back in 2013, I set out to explore the fascinating world of game development. Armed with curiosity and determination, I stumbled upon the “One Game a Month” online game jam — a serendipitous turning point that ignited my passion.

## Repository Overview
This repository houses 13 experimental projects, each "meticulously crafted" within a lot going on in life while the challenge had a tight one-month timeframe for each. As you explore, you’ll encounter a delightful mix of programming languages. But remember, the primary objectives here are learning and fun!

## Key Features
Diverse Experiments: Expect a diverse range of game-related experiments.
Language Variety: Different programming languages were used.
